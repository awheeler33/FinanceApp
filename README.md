Purpose of this project was to create a finance dashboard, based on the tutorials from this youtube creator: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoJ0Tv-BFcQ&list=PLZ5yPTrT42sHZMAq4xZWwqiDgxyEeeWiM&index=4&t=14466s&ab_channel=EdRoh

I have long wanted a cleaner financial dashboard for monitoring monthly income and expenditure, previously using a (horrifficly maintained) excel sheet to monitor my incomings and outgoings. This tutorial allowed me to explore understanding
of Node, MUI, Typescript and React to a stronger level for job related fields, but additionally a play on machine learning has been an interesting and valuable skill to incorporate to the project.

As I intend to use my real financial information on this project I have uploaded the dummy data provided in the model for test purposes.
